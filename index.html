            <h2>Excess to Notes</h2>
            <p>Ensure that you are punctual to your lectures and choose a convenient spot to sit. Students are often put
                off when their favourite corner of the lecture hall has already been taken. Choose a spot that makes you
                comfortable and feel part of the lecture. For me, I prefer the second or third row. I often find it
                difficult to concentrate at the backseats. They remind me of those noisy backbenchers in high school who
                chuckled and contrived pranks to be used on teachers and fellow students!</p>

            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>Teaching is the mirror that reflects the research done to inform oneâ€™s teaching practice. What makes a
                great teacher? Globally, university teaching is often dismissed by academics as being secondary to
                research.Teaching is an essential part of the fabric of academic life. The young minds of today are the
                researchers of tomorrow. Without good teaching, the future of research is not sustainable.</p>
